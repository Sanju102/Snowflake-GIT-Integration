# Snowflake-GIT-Integration

## Step 1: Generate a GitHub PAT
Snowflake requires a PAT to authenticate with your private repositories.

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click your profile photo in the top-right corner and select Settings.
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click Developer settings.
4. Select Personal access tokens > Tokens (Fine-grained tokens).
5. Click Generate new token > Generate new token (classic).
6. Note: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Snowflake Integration").
7. Expiration: Set this according to your security policy (e.g., 90 days).
8. Select Scopes: At a minimum, check the repo box (this grants full control of private repositories).
9. Click Generate token.
10. Copy the token immediately. You will not be able to see it again.
